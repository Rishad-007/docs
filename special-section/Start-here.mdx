## Welcome

I have taken all the APIs from this [jsonPlaceHolder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) page. so if the api does not work, then its promlem is with the site. not mine.

  View the This page  specification file link for more APIs

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
